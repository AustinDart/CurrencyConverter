# CurrencyConverter
Simple Currency Converter app in Java.

Makes use of https://currencylayer.com/

To use this app, you will need to create an account at https://currencylayer.com/ and get an API key. There is a free option that allows 100 API calls per month.

(I would have made my own webserver and ran this local app through that and used my own API key, but I'm a broke college student that has to settle for free workarounds, so you have to get your own API key).

Also uses JSON.simple to parse the JSON objects from CurrencyLayer.
